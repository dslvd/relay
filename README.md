## 🔐 Admin Dashboard

Access at `/admin`

**Features:**
- View all uploaded files
- Delete individual files
- Clear all files at once
- Storage usage statistics
- Cookie-based authentication

## 🤖 Automatic Cleanup

Files are automatically deleted 15 days after their **last access** via:

1. **Vercel Cron Job** - Runs daily at midnight UTC (requires Pro plan)
2. **Manual trigger** - `/api/cleanup` endpoint (for development/hobby plan)
3. **On-demand** - Runs during uploads and history fetches

**How it works:**
- When a file is uploaded, a 15-day timer starts
- Each time someone **views the download page** or **downloads the file**, the timer resets to 15 days
- Files are only deleted if they haven't been accessed for 15 full days
- This keeps popular files alive indefinitely while cleaning up unused ones

## 📊 Storage & Rate Limits

- **File size**: 200MB max per upload
- **Daily quota**: 1GB per IP address
- **Daily uploads**: 100 files per IP
- **Retention**: 15 days since last access (timer resets on download/view)
- **Cache**: No-store headers for history

## 🌐 Deployment

### Vercel (Recommended)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add environment variables:
   - `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (from Vercel Blob store)
   - `ADMIN_PASSWORD` (your admin password)
   - `CRON_SECRET` (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
4. Deploy!

**Note**: Cron jobs require Vercel Pro plan. Hobby plan can use manual cleanup endpoint.

### Environment Variables Setup

In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` | Vercel Blob storage token | Yes |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin dashboard password | Yes |
| `CRON_SECRET` | Secret for cron authentication | Yes (for auto-cleanup) |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID` | Google AdSense Publisher ID | No (for monetization) |

## 💰 Monetization (Optional)

To enable ads and earn revenue:

1. **Sign up for Google AdSense**: Visit [google.com/adsense](https://www.google.com/adsense) and create an account
2. **Get approved**: Submit your site for review (may take 1-3 days)
3. **Get your Publisher ID**: Format is `ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
4. **Add to environment**: 
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_ADSENSE_CLIENT_ID=ca-pub-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
5. **Get Ad Slot IDs**: Create ad units in AdSense dashboard and replace the placeholder IDs in:
   - `app/page.tsx` (line with `dataAdSlot="1234567890"`)
   - `app/download/[...path]/page.tsx` (line with `dataAdSlot="9876543210"`)

**Ad Placements:**
- Main page: After uploaded files list
- Download page: Below download/preview buttons

**Note**: Ads won't show in development mode. Deploy to production to see them.
